RenderDoc is a very powerful tool which can help us find problems with our code/engine/idea.

Most of the time when people start out, first thing which isnt working is the first triangle or the 2nd triangle right after that.

They tend to get a black screen and then don't know what to do next or how to fix it.

That's where `RenderDoc` can help.

You should get it right away from [here](https://renderdoc.org) and install it.

It comes with a useful [Getting Started](https://renderdoc.org/docs/getting_started/index.html) guide which you SHOULD read.

Please read it, it takes only a few minutes but explains the basics of what `RenderDoc` is and how it's used.
